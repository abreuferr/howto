Keepalived provides frameworks for both load balancing and high availability.

High availability is achieved by the Virtual Redundancy Routing Protocol (VRRP)

Keepalived provides two main functions:
- Health checking for LVS systems
- Implementation of the VRRPv2 stack to handle load balancer failover

Keepalived implements the VRRP protocol for director failover.
